# CC3K
This is the video game ChamberCrawler3000 (CC3k), which is a simplified rogue-like (a genre of video game based upon the game Rogue1. A game of CC3k consists of a board 79 columns wide and 30 rows high (5 rows are reserved for displaying information). Game play is as follows: the player character moves through a dungeon and slays enemies and collects treasure until reaching the end of the dungeon (where the end of the dungeon is the 5th floor). A dungeon consists of different floors that consist of chambers connected with passages. In our simplification, each floor will always consist of the same 5 chambers connected in exactly the same way.
For bonus Purposes, we also have a couple more maps that are easier to play and more interesting, feel free to take a look :)
